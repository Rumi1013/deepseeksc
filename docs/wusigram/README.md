#### 1. AI-Powered: Run-Ready Programs from a Single Sentence

**无思微程序** innovatively integrates the DeepSeek model into the development workflow, breaking traditional coding barriers:

1. **Natural Language to Code**
   Simply describe your needs in conversational language (e.g., “Create a cyberpunk-style TodoList”), and the AI generates complete HTML+CSS+JS code automatically—no need to write code line by line.
2. **Dynamic Feature Adjustments**
   You can request changes directly (e.g., “Change the style to cute”), and the AI will instantly update the code—enabling a conversational programming experience.
3. **Beginner-Friendly Design**
   No need to master full syntax rules—users can complete functional development through multiple rounds of interaction with the AI, making it perfect for beginners to quickly test ideas.

#### 2. A Dedicated Development Environment for Mobile

Specifically optimized for mobile scenarios, offering capabilities that traditional PC tools can’t easily provide:

1. **Instant Preview System**
   Code can be pasted or generated and instantly rendered into a visual interface. The runtime experience closely resembles native apps, supporting touch interactions like swiping and tapping.
2. **Standardized Hardware Access**
   Supports access to the phone’s camera (photo/scanning), microphone (voice input), and local storage. A code sample library provides templates for common scenarios.
3. **Multi-Project Management Mode**
   Each HTML project is stored independently, with customizable runtime icons and launch interfaces—allowing users to launch different projects just like opening lightweight apps.

#### 3. Practical Features That Meet Real Needs

1. **Version Time Machine**
   Every modification is automatically saved as a version history, preventing code loss due to accidental changes.
2. **Cloud-Based Backup**
   Local code can optionally be synced to a private cloud space for encrypted storage, enabling cross-device development continuity.
3. **Code Sharing Community**
   An open code hub lets users explore public creative projects (such as mini-games or tool templates) and one-click share their own programs with others—also supporting collaborative development.

#### 4. Full Cross-Platform Support

* **Mobile Devices**:
  iOS users can download from the App Store, Android users can install via their app store
* **Desktop Usage Extensions**:

  * Mac devices (M-series) can run the iOS version natively
  * Windows PCs can use the full features via Android emulators
